# Letter Guessing Game
https://juliusconaway.github.io/Letter-Guess-Game/

You're going to make a game just like the one in the video. Essentially, the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. Put the following text on your page:

Guess what letter I'm thinking of

Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).

I Used css and javascript to dynamically generate a random number first and fore most. Then had specified number of guesses before the game and radomized number would be reset. If the correct number was guessed before the desired amount of guesses the wins score went up one. But if the number was not guessed in time then the losses rose by one. I was able to do all this using javascript functions.
